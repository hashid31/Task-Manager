# Personal Task Manager

A simple and intuitive Java application to help you manage your personal tasks. Add, edit, delete, save, and load tasks with priorities, due dates, and completion status â€” all from an easy-to-use desktop interface.


## Features

The Personal Task Manager provides the following features:

1. **Add Task**: Users can add new tasks by filling out the task details form, including the title, description, due date, and priority.
2. **Mark as Completed**: Users can mark a selected task as completed.
3. **Save Tasks**: Users can save the current list of tasks to a file named `tasks.ser`.
4. **Load Tasks**: Users can load the previously saved tasks from the `tasks.ser` file.
5. **Delete Task**: Users can delete a selected task from the task list.
6. **Persistent Storage**: Save and load your task list using file serialization.

The tasks are displayed in a table, which shows the task name, priority, due date, status, and description.
